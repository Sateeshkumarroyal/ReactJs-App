# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Install dependencies
First, create a react app named 'my-app' and go into the folder:
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
Then, install and save express:
npm install express --save
Once you have finished the above steps, you may run the React app in the development mode: npm run start

## Version of Technologies
node - v16.14.2
npm - 8.5.0
react - 18.2.0

## Folder Structure
After creation, your project should look like this:

project-root/
│
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Component1.js
│   │   ├── Component2.js
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── images/
│   │   ├── styles/
│   │   └── ...

Here's an explanation of each folder and file:

project-root: This is your project's root directory.

src/: This folder contains your source code.

components/: This is where you can organize your React components.

assets/: You can store static assets like images, styles, or fonts here.

App.js: The main entry point for your React application.

index.js: The JavaScript file that renders your React app into the HTML div with the id of "root".

public/: This folder contains public assets and the HTML file where your app is mounted.

index.html: The HTML template for your React app.
node_modules/: This folder is automatically generated and contains the dependencies installed by npm.

package.json: The project configuration file where you specify your project's dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.

package-lock.json: A file generated by npm to lock the versions of your project's dependencies.

README.md: This is where you can write documentation and information about your project.


Creating an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this garment trading company's app using React.js involves several components and functionalities. Below is a high-level outline of how you can structure the project and what each component might include:

### Components:

1. **Registration**
   - Registration form with fields like name, email, password, and activation method (email).
   - Validation for user input.
   - Logic to handle user registration.
   - Activation process (email).

2. **Login**
   - Login form with fields for email and password.
   - Logic to handle user login.
   - Password blocking after 3 failed login attempts.

3. **Logout**
   - A button or link to log out the user.

4. **eKYC Process**
   - Integration with a face capture library for capturing user's face.
   - Validation of valid credentials.
   - Logic to handle eKYC process.

5. **Custom Cloth Order**
   - Form for users to input their body measurements.
   - Logic to calculate the cost for making shirts, dresses, or trousers.
   - User-friendly interface for selecting cloth types.

6. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Interface for administrators to approve / Reject new cloth applications.
   - Logic to manage and approve applications.

7. **In-App Messaging**
   - Integration with a messaging library for in-app messaging.
   - UI for users to send and receive messages.
   - Real-time messaging capabilities.
8. **Dashboard**
    - Customer Kart Deatils Display.
    - If user continue shopping


### Routes:

You can use React Router to handle different routes in your application.

- `/` - Registration Page
- `/login` - Login Page -- Activation Method --- Ekyc
- `/logout` - Logout functionality
- `/dashboard` - User Shopping Kart Deatils
- `/clothApp` - Custom Cloth Order Page
- `/clothApp` - User Shopping Kart Deatils
- `/admin` - Admin Dashboard
- `/forgetPassword` - ForgetPassword 
- `/MessagingApp` -  in-App Messaging used in `/dashboard` component

### API Integration:

Used Default Json

### Extra Points:

- **Component Hierarchy:** Illustrate the hierarchy of React components in the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
